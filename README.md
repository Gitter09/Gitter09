### IC-style decision analysis under incomplete information  
**Risk-first thinking • Capital protection over precision**

---

## What I Do

I build **investment committee–grade work products** that mirror how real decisions are made **before certainty exists**.

My work is not optimized for:
- Academic grading  
- Resume keyword matching  
- Model-driven false precision  

It is optimized for:
- Decision quality under uncertainty  
- Explicit risk framing  
- Capital protection and execution discipline  

If a number is not publicly disclosed, I do **not** invent it.  
If a risk cannot be sized, I **surface it, bound it, and gate decisions around it**.

## What This Repository Represents

This GitHub profile is a **proof-of-work substitute** for:

- Live deal exposure  
- Investment committee rooms  
- Diligence reps  
- MBA / CFA signaling  

Everything here is written **as if it were going to be challenged by a partner**.

---

## How I Think (Non-Negotiables)

- **Judgment > models**  
- **Risk before return**  
- **Execution before upside**  
- **Disclosure gaps are analytically meaningful**  
- **False precision is worse than acknowledged uncertainty**

I treat missing information as a **decision variable**, not an inconvenience.

## What You’ll Find Here

### 🧠 IC-Style Memos  
- Written as internal investment committee documents  
- Grounded strictly in public disclosures  
- Explicit about what is *known*, *unknown*, and *why that matters*  

### 🧭 Project Charters  
- Governing constraints that define:
  - Scope  
  - Methodology  
  - Non-assumptions  
- Designed to eliminate hindsight bias and interpretation drift  

### 🧾 Context Capsules  
- Artifact-specific lenses that explain:
  - Intent  
  - Boundaries  
  - Evaluation standards  
- Ensures the work is judged **as intended**, not as projected

## What This Is *Not*

- ❌ A valuation pitch deck  
- ❌ A forecasting exercise  
- ❌ A post-dataroom underwriting model  
- ❌ A management-backed narrative  

This is **pre-diligence decision framing** — the part most people skip and most capital losses originate from.

---

## Who This Is For

This work is written for people who ask:

- *“What breaks first?”*  
- *“Where are we blind?”*  
- *“What do we need to know before we size this?”*  
- *“What conditions would make this un-investable?”*

If you optimize for certainty, speed, or optics — this is not for you.

---

## Why I Publish This Publicly

Because real decision-making skill is:
- Observable  
- Auditable  
- Portable  

If my thinking holds up **without credentials**, it will hold up with them.

## Contact / Context

If you are reviewing this in a hiring or diligence context,  
start with the **README**, then the **project charter**, then the **final artifact**.

That ordering is intentional.

*This repository reflects how I think when accountability is real and information is incomplete.*
